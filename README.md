# DidgYa

Did you do it? Did you experience it? DidgYa is an app designed to simplify the way you track various things that happen in your life, from daily tasks, like brushing your teeth or drinking water, to things you experience, like a headache or an epiphany.

## Change Log

A [?] denotes that I am considering it, i.e. I'm not sure it should be implemented.

### To-do List

#### Low Priority

-   Integrated Supabase to store the data
    -   [x] createDidgYa
    -   [x] deleteDidgYa
    -   [ ] editDidgYa
    -   [ ] viewDidgYa
    -   [x] clickDidgYa
    -   [x] stopDidgYa
-   integrated Supabase Auth
-   added profile modal
-   5 DidgYas for free in the cloud and save others to localStorage
-   notify the user about being offline
-   [?] added a stopwatch for those with daily goals that shows last time it was done. Only do minutes and hours

#### Medium Priority

-   consider minification tools. This might require initializing node into the project.
-   consider localization libraries, or write my own. One is 33KB minified and another is 55KB minified. I feel like I can make a smaller one.
-   graphs
    -   add a way to view all DidgYas on a single graph, just the datetime
    -   need to adjust axes based on the type of DidgYa
-   apply palette to Tabulizer.js

#### High Priority

-   added editMOdal
-   need to get the width of the view modal to expand to the table width but stay in the center

### Complete
